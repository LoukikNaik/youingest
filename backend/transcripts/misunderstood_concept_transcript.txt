Transcript for: The next outbreak? We’re not ready | Bill Gates | TED
====================================================================

[00:00:17 - 00:00:19]
When I was a kid,

[00:00:19 - 00:00:22]
the disaster we worried about most was a nuclear war.

[00:00:23 - 00:00:27]
That's why we had a barrel like this down in our basement,

[00:00:27 - 00:00:29]
filled with cans of food and water.

[00:00:30 - 00:00:31]
When the nuclear attack came,

[00:00:31 - 00:00:36]
we were supposed to go downstairs, hunker down, and eat out of that barrel.

[00:00:37 - 00:00:41]
Today the greatest risk of global catastrophe

[00:00:41 - 00:00:44]
doesn't look like this.

[00:00:44 - 00:00:47]
Instead, it looks like this.

[00:00:48 - 00:00:53]
If anything kills over 10 million people in the next few decades,

[00:00:53 - 00:00:57]
it's most likely to be a highly infectious virus

[00:00:57 - 00:00:59]
rather than a war.

[00:00:59 - 00:01:03]
Not missiles, but microbes.

[00:01:03 - 00:01:05]
Now, part of the reason for this is that

[00:01:05 - 00:01:10]
we've invested a huge amount in nuclear deterrents.

[00:01:10 - 00:01:15]
But we've actually invested very little in a system to stop an epidemic.

[00:01:16 - 00:01:19]
We're not ready for the next epidemic.

[00:01:20 - 00:01:21]
Let's look at Ebola.

[00:01:21 - 00:01:25]
I'm sure all of you read about it in the newspaper,

[00:01:25 - 00:01:27]
lots of tough challenges.

[00:01:27 - 00:01:30]
I followed it carefully through the case analysis tools

[00:01:30 - 00:01:35]
we use to track polio eradication.

[00:01:35 - 00:01:37]
And as you look at what went on,

[00:01:37 - 00:01:42]
the problem wasn't that there was a system that didn't work well enough,

[00:01:42 - 00:01:45]
the problem was that we didn't have a system at all.

[00:01:46 - 00:01:51]
In fact, there's some pretty obvious key missing pieces.

[00:01:51 - 00:01:55]
We didn't have a group of epidemiologists ready to go, who would have gone,

[00:01:55 - 00:01:59]
seen what the disease was, seen how far it had spread.

[00:01:59 - 00:02:02]
The case reports came in on paper.

[00:02:02 - 00:02:04]
It was very delayed before they were put online

[00:02:04 - 00:02:06]
and they were extremely inaccurate.

[00:02:07 - 00:02:09]
We didn't have a medical team ready to go.

[00:02:09 - 00:02:12]
We didn't have a way of preparing people.

[00:02:12 - 00:02:17]
Now, Médecins Sans Frontières did a great job orchestrating volunteers.

[00:02:17 - 00:02:20]
But even so, we were far slower than we should have been

[00:02:20 - 00:02:24]
getting the thousands of workers into these countries.

[00:02:24 - 00:02:31]
And a large epidemic would require us to have hundreds of thousands of workers.

[00:02:32 - 00:02:37]
There was no one there to look at treatment approaches.

[00:02:37 - 00:02:38]
No one to look at the diagnostics.

[00:02:38 - 00:02:42]
No one to figure out what tools should be used.

[00:02:42 - 00:02:45]
As an example, we could have taken the blood of survivors,

[00:02:45 - 00:02:51]
processed it, and put that plasma back in people to protect them.

[00:02:51 - 00:02:53]
But that was never tried.

[00:02:53 - 00:02:55]
So there was a lot that was missing.

[00:02:55 - 00:02:59]
And these things are really a global failure.

[00:03:00 - 00:03:05]
The WHO is funded to monitor epidemics, but not to do these things I talked about.

[00:03:07 - 00:03:09]
Now, in the movies it's quite different.

[00:03:09 - 00:03:14]
There's a group of handsome epidemiologists ready to go,

[00:03:14 - 00:03:20]
they move in, they save the day, but that's just pure Hollywood.

[00:03:22 - 00:03:25]
The failure to prepare could allow the next epidemic

[00:03:25 - 00:03:29]
to be dramatically more devastating than Ebola

[00:03:30 - 00:03:35]
Let's look at the progression of Ebola over this year.

[00:03:36 - 00:03:39]
About 10,000 people died,

[00:03:39 - 00:03:43]
and nearly all were in the three West African countries.

[00:03:43 - 00:03:46]
There's three reasons why it didn't spread more.

[00:03:46 - 00:03:50]
The first is that there was a lot of heroic work by the health workers.

[00:03:50 - 00:03:54]
They found the people and they prevented more infections.

[00:03:54 - 00:03:56]
The second is the nature of the virus.

[00:03:56 - 00:03:59]
Ebola does not spread through the air.

[00:03:59 - 00:04:01]
And by the time you're contagious,

[00:04:01 - 00:04:04]
most people are so sick that they're bedridden.

[00:04:06 - 00:04:10]
Third, it didn't get into many urban areas.

[00:04:10 - 00:04:12]
And that was just luck.

[00:04:12 - 00:04:14]
If it had gotten into a lot more urban areas,

[00:04:14 - 00:04:17]
the case numbers would have been much larger.

[00:04:17 - 00:04:21]
So next time, we might not be so lucky.

[00:04:21 - 00:04:26]
You can have a virus where people feel well enough while they're infectious

[00:04:26 - 00:04:29]
that they get on a plane or they go to a market.

[00:04:29 - 00:04:32]
The source of the virus could be a natural epidemic like Ebola,

[00:04:32 - 00:04:34]
or it could be bioterrorism.

[00:04:34 - 00:04:39]
So there are things that would literally make things a thousand times worse.

[00:04:39 - 00:04:45]
In fact, let's look at a model of a virus spread through the air,

[00:04:45 - 00:04:49]
like the Spanish Flu back in 1918.

[00:04:49 - 00:04:51]
So here's what would happen:

[00:04:51 - 00:04:55]
It would spread throughout the world very, very quickly.

[00:04:55 - 00:05:00]
And you can see over 30 million people died from that epidemic.

[00:05:00 - 00:05:02]
So this is a serious problem.

[00:05:02 - 00:05:04]
We should be concerned.

[00:05:04 - 00:05:08]
But in fact, we can build a really good response system.

[00:05:08 - 00:05:13]
We have the benefits of all the science and technology that we talk about here.

[00:05:13 - 00:05:14]
We've got cell phones

[00:05:14 - 00:05:18]
to get information from the public and get information out to them.

[00:05:18 - 00:05:22]
We have satellite maps where we can see where people are and where they're moving.

[00:05:22 - 00:05:24]
We have advances in biology

[00:05:24 - 00:05:28]
that should dramatically change the turnaround time to look at a pathogen

[00:05:28 - 00:05:33]
and be able to make drugs and vaccines that fit for that pathogen.

[00:05:33 - 00:05:34]
So we can have tools,

[00:05:34 - 00:05:39]
but those tools need to be put into an overall global health system.

[00:05:39 - 00:05:41]
And we need preparedness.

[00:05:41 - 00:05:44]
The best lessons, I think, on how to get prepared

[00:05:44 - 00:05:46]
are again, what we do for war.

[00:05:46 - 00:05:51]
For soldiers, we have full-time, waiting to go.

[00:05:51 - 00:05:54]
We have reserves that can scale us up to large numbers.

[00:05:54 - 00:05:58]
NATO has a mobile unit that can deploy very rapidly.

[00:05:58 - 00:06:01]
NATO does a lot of war games to check, are people well trained?

[00:06:01 - 00:06:03]
Do they understand about fuel and logistics

[00:06:03 - 00:06:06]
and the same radio frequencies?

[00:06:06 - 00:06:08]
So they are absolutely ready to go.

[00:06:08 - 00:06:13]
So those are the kinds of things we need to deal with an epidemic.

[00:06:13 - 00:06:15]
What are the key pieces?

[00:06:15 - 00:06:20]
First, we need strong health systems in poor countries.

[00:06:20 - 00:06:23]
That's where mothers can give birth safely,

[00:06:23 - 00:06:25]
kids can get all their vaccines.

[00:06:25 - 00:06:29]
But, also where we'll see the outbreak very early on.

[00:06:30 - 00:06:31]
We need a medical reserve corps:

[00:06:31 - 00:06:34]
lots of people who've got the training and background

[00:06:34 - 00:06:37]
who are ready to go, with the expertise.

[00:06:37 - 00:06:42]
And then we need to pair those medical people with the military.

[00:06:42 - 00:06:46]
taking advantage of the military's ability to move fast, do logistics

[00:06:46 - 00:06:48]
and secure areas.

[00:06:48 - 00:06:51]
We need to do simulations,

[00:06:51 - 00:06:55]
germ games, not war games, so that we see where the holes are.

[00:06:55 - 00:06:58]
The last time a germ game was done in the United States

[00:06:58 - 00:07:02]
was back in 2001, and it didn't go so well.

[00:07:02 - 00:07:07]
So far the score is germs: 1, people: 0.

[00:07:07 - 00:07:13]
Finally, we need lots of advanced R&amp;D in areas of vaccines and diagnostics.

[00:07:13 - 00:07:17]
There are some big breakthroughs, like the Adeno-associated virus,

[00:07:17 - 00:07:21]
that could work very, very quickly.

[00:07:21 - 00:07:24]
Now I don't have an exact budget for what this would cost,

[00:07:24 - 00:07:29]
but I'm quite sure it's very modest compared to the potential harm.

[00:07:29 - 00:07:33]
The World Bank estimates that if we have a worldwide flu epidemic,

[00:07:33 - 00:07:37]
global wealth will go down by over three trillion dollars

[00:07:37 - 00:07:41]
and we'd have millions and millions of deaths.

[00:07:41 - 00:07:44]
These investments offer significant benefits

[00:07:44 - 00:07:46]
beyond just being ready for the epidemic.

[00:07:46 - 00:07:48]
The primary healthcare, the R&amp;D,

[00:07:48 - 00:07:51]
those things would reduce global health equity

[00:07:51 - 00:07:55]
and make the world more just as well as more safe.

[00:07:55 - 00:07:58]
So I think this should absolutely be a priority.

[00:07:59 - 00:08:00]
There's no need to panic.

[00:08:00 - 00:08:05]
We don't have to hoard cans of spaghetti or go down into the basement.

[00:08:05 - 00:08:09]
But we need to get going, because time is not on our side.

[00:08:09 - 00:08:15]
In fact, if there's one positive thing that can come out of the Ebola epidemic,

[00:08:15 - 00:08:21]
it's that it can serve as an early warning, a wake-up call, to get ready.

[00:08:21 - 00:08:26]
If we start now, we can be ready for the next epidemic.

[00:08:26 - 00:08:28]
Thank you.

[00:08:28 - 00:08:31]
(Applause)
